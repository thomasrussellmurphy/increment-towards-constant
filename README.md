# increment-towards-constant
Experimentally determining how far you can increment floating-point implementations. It's not like the theory can explain what's up without playing around with the manual counting or anything...

Not an incredibly exciting piece of work, but it definitely points to the fact that these languages have the same or very similar underlying implementations of floating point numbers.
